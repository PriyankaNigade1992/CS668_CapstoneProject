# Methodology:
Data Augmentation: Two transformation pipelines are utilized using PyTorch's transformations module to standardise input images.<br /> 
The split-folders package is used to ensure an even distribution of each class across Train and test subsets.<br /> 
Models utilized are: ResNet34, ResNext101_32x16d_wsl, GoogleNet and ShuffleNet.(Minimize risk of vanishing gradient, light weight, state-of-the-art performance , Requires limited computational resources)<br /> 
Model selection is based on complexity, accuracy, and suitability for the available computational resources and dataset size.<br /> 
Model accuracy is used as a measure of performance.
